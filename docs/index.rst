Ethplay is a platform for implementation and management of gaming applications on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethplay provides basis functionalities for managing interactions between game developers, game hosts, players, investors, advertisers, and more.
Using Ethplay, hosting a game is as easy as sending a transaction.

Ethplay aims to become a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), completely owned and managed by its token holders.
