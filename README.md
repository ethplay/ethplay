Ethplay is a decentralized autonomous ecosystem powering gaming applications on the ethereum blockchain.

## Unique features ##

* Users can play and host games. Games can be hosted without special programming skills. Starting an instance of a provably fair casino game on the ethereum blockchain will be as easy as sending a transaction.

* Game developers can create and submit new game types and receive a share of proceeds throughout game lifetime.

* Ethplay base libraries allow developers to focus on game logic rather than other complex issues, such as security or random number generation.

* Investors can invest in games and receive profits.

* Ethplay is fueled by a token with enhanced functionalities: dividend distribution,  platform governance, and in-game currency. Token holders will be the ultimate owners of the platform.

* Proceeds will be transferred to token holders.

* Platform governance by token holders: decisions on game promotion, network parameters and cost structure (planned).
