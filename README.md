# ethplay #
Ethplay is a decentralized autonomous ecosystem powering online gaming and casino applications on the ethereum blockchain.

## Unique features ##

* Users can play and host games. Games can be hosted without needing special programming skills. For instance, hosting a provably fair casino game on the ethereum blockchain is as easy as sending a transaction.

* Game developers can create and submit new games types and earn money from game proceeds throughout its lifetime.

* A simple game creation workflow allows developers to focus on game logic rather than complicated security aspects. Ethplay provides the needed base libraries.

* Investors can invest in games.

* Ethplay is fueled by a token with enhanced functionalities: dividend distribution,  platform governance, and in-game currency. Token holders will be the ultimate owners of the platform.

* Proceeds will be transferred to token holders automatically.

* Platform governance by token holders: decisions on game promotion, network parameters and cost structure (planned).
